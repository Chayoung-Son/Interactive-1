        <h1>THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS</h1></div>
 <p>
 Floriography roughly translates to “the language of flowers” and has been used as a means of cryptological communication simply by the way flowers are arranged, their colour and variety. To say that their unique language is fascinating and deeply romantic is an understatement. Floriography has the innate ability to embody the most captivating of human emotions and leave nothing but warmth in its wake.</br></p>
